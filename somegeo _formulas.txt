 Regular Polygon Formulas
===============================

Given:
- n = number of sides
- a = side length
- R = circumradius (circle outside)
- r = inradius (circle inside)

1) Interior Angle:
    interior_angle = (n - 2) * 180 / n
    -> angle inside each corner of the polygon.

2) Central Angle:
    central_angle = 360 / n
    -> angle from center between two adjacent vertices.

3) Perimeter:
    P = n * a
    -> total boundary length.

4) Area:
    A = (n * a^2) / (4 * tan(pi / n))
    -> standard formula for area using number of sides and side length.

5) Circumradius (R):
    R = a / (2 * sin(pi / n))
    -> radius of the circle that passes through all vertices.

6) Inradius (r):
    r = a / (2 * tan(pi / n))
    -> radius of the circle touching all sides from inside.

7) Area using inradius:
    A = (P * r) / 2
    -> alternative area formula when perimeter and inradius are known.

8) Relationship between R and r:
    r = R * cos(pi / n)
    -> connects outer radius and inner radius.

 Circle Geometry Formulas
===============================

Given:
- R = radius
- d = diameter = 2R
- theta = angle in radians

1) Circumference:
    C = 2 * pi * R
    -> total distance around the circle.

2) Area:
    A = pi * R^2
    -> space enclosed by the circle.

3) Arc Length:
    arc = R * theta
    -> length of curved boundary for central angle theta.

4) Sector Area:
    sector_area = 0.5 * R^2 * theta
    -> area of a "pizza slice" with angle theta.

5) Chord Length:
    chord = 2 * R * sin(theta / 2)
    -> straight line between two points on the circle.

6) Segment Height (h):
    h = R - sqrt(R^2 - (chord/2)^2)
    -> distance from chord to arc (sagitta).

7) Segment Area:
    segment_area = 0.5 * R^2 * (theta - sin(theta))
    -> area between a chord and the arc above it.

8) Relationship between arc, chord, angle:
    chord = sqrt(2 * R^2 * (1 - cos(theta)))
    -> chord from radius and angle without using sine.

9) Power of a Point:
    (tangent_length)^2 = external_segment * whole_secant
    -> relates lengths when drawing tangents/secants from a point.
